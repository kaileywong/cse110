## Programming
My favorite programming languages (in descending order):

1. Python
2. Java
3. JavaScript
4. C++
5. ~~HTML/CSS~~

My favorite language is Python. Here's an example of using list comprehension in Python:
```
note_frequencies = {
    'A': 440.00,
    'B': 493.88,
    'C': 261.63,
    'D': 293.66,
    'E': 329.63,
    'F': 349.23,
    'G': 392.00
}
notes = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G']

# List comprehension to get frequencies of notes
frequencies = [note_frequencies[note] for note in notes]
```
